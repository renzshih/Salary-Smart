Starting up the Payroll System:

Step 0: Recognize the directory for files
	Open any data file using the terminal or command prompt
	The output should look like this (C:\Users\ASUS>"C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Payroll System\July 22-28\Potato.csv)
	Recognize the User Name: \Users\(User Name)\Desktop\Payroll System\July 22-28\Potato.csv
	This will be asked from in each Python notebook

Step 1: Go to folder "1 Information CSVs" and open "Employee-Information"
	Edit information in "Employee-Information" to suit the employees of the company

Step 2: Run "1 Tax Calculator.ipnyb"
	This will calculate each employee's tax information with respect to there monthly salary
	The notebook will output a csv named "Employee-Information-With-Tax"

Step 3: In folder "1 Information CSVs", open "Standard-Clock-Hours"
	Edit information in "Standard-Clock-Hours" to suit the company's clock-in and clock-out hours

Step 4: Make a folder for each operating week
	Use folder "July 22-28" as an example
	The "folder name" folder should contain folders: 
		1. In-"folder name"
		2. Out-"folder name"
		3. html-"folder name"
		
Step 5: Run "2 In-Day Format.ipynb"
	This will generate a formated csv that is editable
	This should be the format for all INPUTS

Step 6: Make sure to put all INPUTS are in the folder - In-"folder name"

Step 7: When one week of INPUTS have been collected, run "3 Output Notebook.ipynb"
	This notebook will ask for the "folder name" and "input name"
	(i.e. "July 22-28" and "July 22")

Step 8: Once the Out-"folder name" contains the OUTPUTS run "4 One Week Statistic Generator.ipynb"
	This notebook will ask for the "folder name" and each name of the INPUTS
	The notebook will also ask for a name (for the whole week's worth of info = One Week Statistic)

Step 9: When the One Week Statistic has been made, run 5 Pay Slip Generator.ipynb
	This notebook will ask for the "folder name"
	The end output will create html files for each employee's payslip in folder: html-"folder name"

Step 10: With the html's, the company can print out each payslip

Notes:	If the company wants to issue debt to an employee, follow the format in folder "3 Debt Info"
	Each employee will have their own csv containing all the debts they have
	The name of this csv should be DebtTracker_"Employee ID Number" (i.e. DebtTracker_10000000)
	When there is debt remaining, "3 Output Notebook.ipynb" will take into account remaining debt
